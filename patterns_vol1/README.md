# Pattens vol.1

https://hirokimatsui.bandcamp.com/album/patterns-vol-1-2

## Execution Environment

Each track was performed using its corresponding .tidal file and recorded in a single take.

The audio from each orbit was recorded as a multitrack session in a DAW, where I applied post-processing such as volume balancing, EQ, and spatial effects.

Tidal runs on a Raspberry Pi (4B, 8GB RAM) mounted within the modular system.

## Code

- Each track from d1 to d8 is customized as a mono output and sent through the ES-8 audio interface.
- The sound "midi" is connected to a Mutant Brain (Hexinverter) module for control signals.
- The Mutant Brain configuration file is located at config_files/mb_surgery.syx.
- Some MIDI outputs and audio signals are processed through a Generation Loss mkII unit.

## To Be Added...
- SCD startup file
- ModularGrid link
- Custom samples
